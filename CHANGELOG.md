# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-04

Theme: adoption. Everything a first-time visitor needs that the engine
releases didn't ship: a getting-started walkthrough for the contract-first
agent workflow, sample projects in all three supported languages, and the
strongest possible existence proof — heddle developing heddle, its own stable
seams under contract (written `inferred` by the agent, since reviewed and
explicitly confirmed by a human, at zero re-verification cost). No code
changes: the engine is 0.2.0's; the 5 MCP tools / 5 CLI commands surface and
all response shapes are unchanged.

### Added
- Heddle develops on heddle: the repo is now itself a heddle project —
  `contracts/` holds 12 contracts over the stable seams (the five `api.py`
  tool functions, the hashing trio, `impl_hash`, `verification_key`,
  `HeddleError`, the `Store` Protocol), bound to the existing test suite and
  born `status: inferred` pending human review. `heddle verify --radius` is
  the inner-loop gate for changes to contracted seams; the full pytest suite
  and the benchmark remain the definition of done.
- A getting-started walkthrough, `docs/getting-started.md`: how a human and an
  agent build a package contract-first — setup, the CLAUDE.md working rules to
  give the agent, the inferred→confirmed review loop, and the `verify --radius`
  gate as the definition of done.
- A TypeScript sample project, `examples/ts-cart`: 8 contracts over a shopping
  cart (interface/type-alias contracts included), exercising the TypeScript
  adapter end to end — canonical-AST impl hashing via the project's own
  `typescript`, `node:test` verification under type stripping, and the
  `verify --radius` gate.
- A Go sample project, `examples/go-ledger`: 8 contracts over a small
  double-entry ledger (struct/type contracts included), exercising the Go
  adapter end to end — AST-stable impl hashing, `go test -json` verification,
  and the `verify --radius` gate.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-04

Theme: solo → team. A team can now share verification greens — one teammate or
CI verifies a unit once and everyone gets `cached-pass` — soundly, keyed by
toolchain. Plus two new language adapters, contract provenance, and a
CI-gateable verify. Everything is additive: the 5 MCP tools / 5 CLI commands
surface and the contract format are unchanged, and 0.1.0 projects work as-is.
One-time cost on upgrade: existing cached greens re-verify once (the
verification key now includes the toolchain).

### Added
- Gate-shaped verification: `verify` responses carry a top-level `ok` — true iff
  every unit is `pass`/`cached-pass` (failures, unknown names, and unverifiable
  units all gate) — and a `radius` option (`heddle verify --radius NAME`, MCP
  `verify(names, radius=true)`) widens each name to itself plus every transitive
  dependent, spec-only units dropped. One call = a hard pass/fail for a change's
  whole blast radius; the CLI exit code mirrors `ok`, so a CI step or agent loop
  can block on it. No new tools/commands.
- Contract provenance: an optional `status: inferred | confirmed` field on
  contracts. `inferred` marks a contract reverse-engineered from code and not
  yet human-reviewed; tools warn — never refuse — when a decision rests on one
  (`inferred: true` on `get_dependents`/`get_contract` dep entries, `inferred`
  and `invalidated_inferred` on `put_contract`, an `inferred` list on `verify`
  results, and a review-queue list in `status`). Absent = `confirmed`, so
  existing contracts are unaffected, and the field is excluded from the contract
  hash, so confirming an inferred contract after review invalidates nothing and
  busts no cached green. The 5-tool / 5-CLI surface is unchanged; every new
  response key appears only when an inferred contract is actually involved.
- Remote shared verification cache (transport): a `RemoteStore` client and a
  stdlib `python -m heddle.cache_server` (a bearer-token JSON HTTP service over a
  `SqliteStore`) let a team share verdicts and impl blobs across machines —
  configured per project via `.heddle/config.json` `{"shared": {"url","token"}}`,
  with **no change to the 5 MCP tools / 5 CLI commands** (the cache server is an
  operational process, not a subcommand). A shared-store outage degrades silently
  to local verify. Cross-machine greens are made sound by the toolchain-in-key
  change below.
- Toolchain in the verification key: the key now folds in a per-language toolchain
  identity (`python 3.11.7` / `go 1.21.5` / `node <v> ts <v>`), so a shared or
  cross-machine green is trusted only when the toolchain version matches —
  otherwise it re-runs. Version-only (no OS/arch), so a CI(Linux) green still
  serves a Mac/Windows dev. One-time: existing greens re-verify once on upgrade.
- Semantic diff in `put_contract`: the response carries a `diff` of what changed
  versus the prior contract (signature, deps, invariants, examples, impl/tests).
- Test source in the verification key (#18): editing a test's body now forces a
  re-run; reformatting, comments, and docstrings in a test stay cached. Conftest
  fixtures and helpers a test calls are not yet covered.
- Content-addressed impl-source store: `heddle index` stores each impl file's
  source as a deduped blob, so the store can serve weft, not only verdicts.
- A backend-agnostic `Store` interface (a Protocol) with `SqliteStore` as the
  local implementation: the seam for a shared/remote cache.
- Shared verification cache MVP (`LayeredStore`): a local store fronted by a
  shared one (read-through, write-through for greens), so one client's verified
  green serves another. Design for the hosted service in docs/hosted-store.md.
- Multi-language adapters: contracts whose `impl` is a `.go` file verify with a
  Go adapter (a stdlib `go/ast` hash helper plus `go test -json`), chosen by the
  impl's extension. Python is unchanged and the default; the contract syntax and
  the 5-tool / 5-CLI surface are unchanged.
- TypeScript adapter: contracts whose `impl` is a `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.mts`/`.cts` file
  verify with a TypeScript adapter — a hand-written canonical AST hash via the TS
  Compiler API (resolved from the project's own `typescript`, since TS has no
  `ast.dump`), plus an auto-detected test runner (vitest / jest if declared in
  `package.json`, else Node's built-in `node:test`). Needs Node (>= 22.6 for `.ts`
  type-stripping under `node:test`). Python and Go are unchanged; the contract
  syntax and the 5-tool / 5-CLI surface are unchanged.
- A `rechecks` block in `status` (#20): re-verifications triggered by a contract
  change, and how many changed no verdict (`wasted_rate`).
- Invariants out of the contract hash (#19): rewording or reordering an invariant
  no longer changes the hash or cascades a re-verify. Invariants are documentation;
  the machine check is the tests (their source is in the key via #18). One-time:
  contracts with invariants re-hash once on upgrade.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-23

First public release, published to PyPI as `heddle-mcp` (the import name and CLI
stay `heddle`).

### Added
- Content-addressed contracts: one hashable YAML file per software unit
  (signature, invariants, examples, dependencies), with subdirectory namespaces.
- Hash-keyed verification cache: a green test result keyed on the contract,
  implementation, and transitive dependency hashes. pytest runs only on a miss;
  failures are never served from cache.
- Mechanical blast radius: `get_dependents` reports the exact set of invalidated
  dependents, direct or transitive, by hash.
- Five MCP tools (`get_contract`, `put_contract`, `get_dependents`, `verify`,
  `status`) and five CLI commands (`init`, `index`, `serve`, `status`, `verify`).
- Configurable verify interpreter and timeout via `heddle serve --python`,
  `.heddle/config.json`, or an auto-detected project `.venv`.
- `--no-pycache-trust` / `pycache_trust` to clear stale `__pycache__` before a
  verify run.
- Structured errors over MCP (no stack traces).
- CI (tests on Python 3.10 through 3.13 plus the >5x benchmark guard) and PyPI
  Trusted Publishing on version tags.
